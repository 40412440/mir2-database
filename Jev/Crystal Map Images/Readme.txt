Jev's dtbs original full size map pack has 2547 maps + 18 images = 2565 files

Note: the Imgs are much fewer than maps because maps have many duplicates, only the first map in each repeated sequence has Img to go with it.

The duplicate maps along with their images were removed in the sorting of "Jev's Map Pack Sorted" and were placed in the folder 'Duplicates'.

Some images have my note after their name, enclosed in square brackets, mostly to number map details if more than one was taken, ie. [det. #]

The whole point of the Imgs is to get an idea of what's in the map pack. Minimaps only provide good identification of cave or temple floor layout but mostly you can't tell from them what type of walls and flooring the cave has and in that case I snapped a close up detail 'mapname.gif' screenshot of the map. 

In cases where the map editor allowed for zooming out to make much bigger full screen of the complete map, I didn't include the minimap (except in caves where the minimap allows for better identification of the cave floor layout).


"Jev's Map Pack Sorted" contains maps with their images sorted out into their individual map sets. In cases where I didn't know the cave or temple name, I made it up going by the place appearance. I included a txt file with the folder names of the whole 'sorted' directory and would welcome it if someone who knows more cave names would append those names after the existing one I gave the maps (and send me back the txt list for when I continue completing the map collection).

Some maps are not complete sets, also some maps need fixing. I set the map editor to read the libraries from the Jev's May 15 2021 database upload but some maps have flaws, some easy to fix, others require extensive work. If you know of more complete lib set, I would like to have it.

BTW some maps, notably A

Before starting to fix those incomplete and flawed maps, we need to look around if they exist fixed somewhere or if someone already fixed them for their server.
